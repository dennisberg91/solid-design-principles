# Single-responsibility principle

In short:

> Every module, class, or function in a computer program should have responsibility over _a single part_
> of that program's functionality.

## Assignment

Write a module that, given objects implementing `TyreInterface` and `SteeringWheelInterface`, constructs
a new object called `Car`.

Additional requirements are that a car must have one steering wheel and four tires.

## Done?

Share your code. Give a couple of examples where you have applied the single-responsibility principle.
