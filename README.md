# SOLID design principles

This repository contains assignments regarding each of the five principles that together form the SOLID design
principles:

* [Single-responsibility principle](SingleResponsibility/README.md)
* [Open-closed principle](OpenClosed/README.md)
* [Liskov substitution principle](LiskovSubstitution/README.md)
* [Interface segregation principle](InterfaceSegregation/README.md)
* [Dependency inversion principle](DependencyInversion/README.md)

## Before you begin

Please read this entire README before you begin.

### Feedback
I love getting constructive feedback. I've created this repository for improving people's theoretical and practical
software development skills, and I am by no means an exception. I make mistakes all the time, and find myself reading
theory that I already read years ago.

So have you spotted an error? Got an idea for improving or extending this repository? Don't be shy!

Simply
[open a discussion](https://github.com/mmbakker/solid-design-principles/discussions),
[report an issue](https://github.com/mmbakker/solid-design-principles/issues), or
[create a pull request](https://github.com/mmbakker/solid-design-principles/pulls). Thanks!

### Required knowledge
Each assignment is based on the assumption that you know what the SOLID design principles are, and understand them - at
least at a basic level. A short summary of what the principles are about can be found at the beginning of all
assignments as a "fresher-upper".

### Doing the tasks
Try to complete a task first, without doing additional research or otherwise getting help. This way you'll learn which
principles you know by heart and which ones you might want to dive into a bit more.

### Good luck!
